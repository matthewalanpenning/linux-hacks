#So with I open multiple bash terminals up, the bash history is not saved between them. This can easily be fixed by changing
#the SSH Options to append history.

#Use the following command to set the histappend option
shopt -s histappend

#To view your settings just run:
shopt

#To unset (turn it off) run:
shopt -u histappend
